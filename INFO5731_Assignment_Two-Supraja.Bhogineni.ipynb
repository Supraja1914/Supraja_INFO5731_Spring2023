    "Constituency parsing tree, also known as phrase structure tree, is a tree representation of the syntactic structure of a sentence. \n",
    "It breaks down a sentence into its constituent parts, such as noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases, and clauses. \n",
    "The tree structure consists of nodes and branches. Each node represents a constituent, and the branches represent the relationship between the constituents. \n",
    "For instance, the tree can show how words form a noun phrase or how a noun phrase and a verb form a clause. \n",
    "Constituency parsing tree can be used for tasks such as natural language understanding, machine translation, and text-to-speech conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency parsing tree, on the other hand, represents the grammatical and semantic relationships between the words in a sentence. \n",
    "It focuses on identifying the main word or headword of a sentence and its dependent words, which modify or give more information about the headword.\n",
    "Dependency parsing tree also uses nodes and branches, where each node represents a word, and the branches indicate the relationship between the words. \n",
    "In this tree, the headword of a sentence is the root node, and its dependent words are connected to it via directed edges. \n",
    "For example, a preposition word like \"in\" will be connected to the headword it modifies, such as a noun word like \"house,\" through a directed edge. \n",
    "Dependency parsing tree can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question-answering, and information extraction.\n",
